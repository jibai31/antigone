In Greek mythology, Antigone is the daughter of Oedipus and Jocasta, Oedipus' mother. The name has been suggested to mean "opposed to motherhood", "in place of a mother". It may also mean "against men" since men were dominant in the Ancient Greek family structure, and Antigone clearly defied masculine authority, or "anti-generative", from the root gon., "that which generates" (related: gonos, "-gony"; seed, semen).

Antigone is also a neighborhood of Montpellier, France.
